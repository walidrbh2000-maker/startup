//
// Pure algorithm utilities for worker ranking.
// No Flutter / Firebase imports — fully unit-testable.
//
// Algorithms:
//   • bayesianRating  — prevents cold-start and low-volume rating inflation
//   • workerScore     — composite ranking (rating + distance + recency)
//
// ALGO FIX (A5):
//   workerScore() previously accepted bayesianRatingValue but had no
//   reviewCount parameter. Callers passed worker.averageRating (raw average)
//   without any cold-start guard, meaning a newly-registered worker with zero
//   reviews and averageRating=0.0 received the minimum possible score instead
//   of the platform globalAverage — suppressing new workers unfairly.
//
//   Fix: add `int reviewCount = 0` parameter.
//   When reviewCount == 0, substitute globalAverage for the rating component
//   (same cold-start logic as bayesianRating()). When reviewCount > 0, use
//   bayesianRatingValue as provided (caller is responsible for Bayesian
//   computation; passing averageRating is also acceptable when reviewCount
//   is known — workerScore normalises the value by 5.0 either way).
